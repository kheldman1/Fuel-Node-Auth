Fuel Auth (for Node.js) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ExactTarget/Fuel-Node-Auth.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ExactTarget/Fuel-Node-Auth)
=============

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/fuel-auth.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/fuel-auth/)

This library allows users to create authentication clients for ExactTarget APIs.

Use our [REST][1] and [SOAP][2] clients to interact with these APIs at a low-level.

This library is compatible with:
- Node.js
  - 0.8
  - 0.10
  - 0.12
- io.js
 
`npm install` will error if you're using node version 0.8 with developer dependencies. To have a successful install for testing/contributing use `npm install -g npm@1.2.8000` and the issue should be resolved.
